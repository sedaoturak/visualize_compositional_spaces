# Multidimensional compositional space visualization
This repository includes a notebook to plot compositional space of multi-component materials as property maps. The Jupyter notebook includes two code snippets for static and interactive plotting. Static plot might be good for publishing or reporting purposes, while interactive plotting can be used for data analysis or teaching purposes.

For demostration purpose, the dataset published in [this article](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2025/dd/d5dd00361j) was used to generate the example plots below.

Static plot by matplotlib            |  Interactive plot by plotly
